# car-spring-boot-rest-api

The challenges i faced while making this project were many.But i think it was a roller coster ride for 2 days. In these two days i have explored many things.

1] the first challenge i faced was adding the project to the local system .
Connecting the project with the github.

2]after that when i was implementing the crud operations i was able to get the data from two objects from postman but other object were showing null.It took my 4 hours to solve that problem

3]Before that i have used the DAO only and this time i came across DTO which was very challenging. There was the mapping error while mapping the object .

4]After implementing the crud i started working on security i have written the code of roll based login but i could not achieve it due to time constraints.

5]At last all the things went good and have learned many new things.
